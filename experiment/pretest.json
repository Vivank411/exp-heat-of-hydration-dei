    {
      "question": "What is the primary reason for determining the heat of hydration of cement?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To measure the setting time of cement",
        "b": "To prevent thermal cracking in concrete",
        "c": "To determine the fineness of cement",
        "d": "To improve the workability of cement"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Heat of hydration generates heat, which can cause thermal cracking in large concrete structures if not managed properly."
      }
    },
    {
      "question": "Which chemical reaction occurs when water is added to cement?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Oxidation",
        "b": "Hydration",
        "c": "Reduction",
        "d": "Evaporation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Hydration is the chemical reaction where cement reacts with water to form a paste that binds aggregates together."
      }

    {
      "question": "What type of reaction is the hydration of cement?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Endothermic",
        "b": "Exothermic",
        "c": "Neutral",
        "d": "Reversible"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Hydration of cement is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat as the cement sets and hardens."
      }
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is gypsum added to cement?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase strength",
        "b": "To accelerate the setting time",
        "c": "To control the rapid heat and reaction of C₃A",
        "d": "To improve fineness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Gypsum is added to control the rapid hydration of C₃A (tricalcium aluminate), preventing flash setting of cement."
      }
    },
    {
      "question": "Which apparatus is used to determine the heat of hydration of cement?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vicat’s apparatus",
        "b": "Le Chatelier’s apparatus",
        "c": "Potentiometer",
        "d": "Calorimeter"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "A calorimeter is used to measure the heat of hydration of cement by quantifying the heat released during hydration."
